[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/mb-ucfirst-lcfirst/v)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/mb-ucfirst-lcfirst) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/mb-ucfirst-lcfirst/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/mb-ucfirst-lcfirst) [![PHP Version Require](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/mb-ucfirst-lcfirst/require/php)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/mb-ucfirst-lcfirst)

Provides user-land PHP polyfills for the [`mb_ucfirst` and `mb_ucfirst` functions added in PHP 8.4](https://php.watch/versions/8.4/mb_ucfirst-mb_ucfirst).

Requires PHP 8,1, 8.2 or PHP 8.3 with `mbstring` extension. Not supported on PHP 8.4 because these functions are natively implemented in PHP 8.4.

## Installation

```bash
composer require polyfills/mb-ucfirst-lcfirst
```

## Usage

Simply use the `mb_ucfirst` and `mb_ucfirst` functions as if they were declared already.
